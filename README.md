# Interactive Content Repository

This is a unified authoring platform that makes it easy (for reasonably computer-savvy users) to make academic content in all its forms available on the web in a coherent and easily maintained way, increasing both presence and reach of the work going on in an AI research group or CDT.

To contribute create a .md file in the project root.
